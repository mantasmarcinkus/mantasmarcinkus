![What\`s next](/content/images/2017/1/whatsnext.png)  

A question that I asked myself, shortly after New Year\`s
celebrations, and it should arise for every developer in his career (at 
least several times maybe), and if it doesn\`t - HR staff will (probably) 
ask it during interview by HR staff - because it shows what
to expect from the person and if he has a plan. \`***How do you see 
yourself in five years time***?\` - I gave this question to myself, and 
I couldn\`t answer honestly, *without lying to myself*. In this fast
paced world, where every week we have a new Javascript framework, who 
do developers want to become?
How do I plan to answer this question to myself? I would love to
gain the experience from other developers, who have already walked this 
path by answering this question or just taking the path for 5 years.
How do these people changed their job title and what characteristics
they had, what they lacked, what challenges they met? I will 
do this answering thing as deep as I can - because **it is my future**, 
which I build for myself. And maybe, just maybe, someone reading this
will gain something from my experiences.

#### How was it before the question?
Firstly, how did I came across this question? *Not so long ago*,
everything seemed so clear - I was a team lead and worked with several
developers and was very happy that I had a chance to help the team 
and every person in the team. But surprise, surprise - I was not ready
at all. During that time, it seemed that I was coping with the tasks
quite well and looked after the people in my team so they could grow.
But, when I think now and reflect on my experience - it is obvious,
that I have done a lot of mistakes, and some things I did not even
have courage or time to do. I hope, that it did no real harm for 
the team, because I feel I was a really neutral team lead. But now 
I think I could have done much better because there was a lot of 
space to grow and improve. But I needed a kick to my bottom -
and there was none - I was in a such a *comfort zone*.

#### How did I stumble upon it?

This kick happened when we were having a farewell beer and my ex team
lead (whom I replaced (*sir VA*)) asked me this *intriguing* question.
And probably, because there was enough beer already, thoughts and talks
drowned during the evening. It got to me, when I moved to London and 
had multiple interviews where this question was asked again and again.
The second kick - was I had to change a job to dare openly ask this 
question. Naturally for me, this stuck with me until now. How do I see
myself in five years time? What is that I seek? *What is my life\`s purpose?*
No, I will leave latter for later, as they are very hard for my dumb
head.

#### The possibilities

Because I had been in the team lead\`s shoes (although, I\`ve made those
uncomfortable), naturally, that I would want to try make a better effort
in the future. *But maybe, there is another way?* Taking a glance over 
current job offers and positions you could acquire after software 
development - generally I can see five of them:
 - Senior developer/engineer
 - Tech lead
 - Team lead
 - Architect
 - IT department manager (CTO)

Of course, all of them are somewhat similar, but they have key
differences. I know, what you are thinking - these might be a quite
unreachable goals in five years time or that these titles follow each 
other as a carrer path. I hear you. What if I would not go further 
than any of the particular title? 

#### Issues

The problem that I already *clearly* see, that these titles have different
growth paths and even more *worrying* that these titles that are used in 
companies differentiate in definition and responsibilities. It may even
happen that one title can have the definition and responsibilities of 
the other. But this seem to happen to most of the professions.

#### The plan

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

My quest, obviously, is to answer The question. This can be completed
by sitting down and doing some research how these titles look generalised
from different sources. Most likely, in the several upcoming months,
I will try to find as much text information about the titles adding people\`s
experiences who are working in these positions. I hope, that it will help
me to make a plan: how and what I need to reach my vision and answer 
this ***damned question***.
